# nix-config

A repo to keep all my .dotfiles for easy setup when I switch computers and servers as a backup.

## Setup

This uses [Vundle.vim](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim). To set up, run 

    git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

Then go into vim and type `:BundleInstall`.
